Known properties
================

*Known properties* refer to properties of simfiles and their charts that the
current stable version of StepMania actively uses. These are the properties
that StepMania's built-in editor will preserve when it saves a simfile that was
loaded from disk; any unknown properties will be lost if overwritten by the
editor.

**simfile** enables you to access properties of simfiles & charts in a few
different ways:

* **Indexing** (e.g. :code:`sim['TITLE']`, :code:`chart['STEPSTYPE']`) provides
  access to all properties via uppercase names. (They're converted to uppercase
  so you don't need to!)

  - Both indexing and **.get()** (e.g. :code:`sim.get('TITLE')`,
    :code:`chart.get('STEPSTYPE')`) are features of the underlying
    :code:`OrderedDict`. You may prefer to use .get() to handle missing
    properties without having to catch a :code:`KeyError`.

* **Attributes** (e.g. :code:`sim.title`, :code:`chart.stepstype`) provide
  access to *known properties* via lowercase names. Like .get(), missing
  properties return None.

All of these options have their benefits and drawbacks. Indexing is a quick &
intuitive way to access any property; .get() can handle any property, even if
it's missing; attributes, though limited to known properties, are implicitly
spell-checked and arguably look the nicest in code. Both indexing and
attributes can handle reads, writes, and deletes, and all methods are backed by
the same data structure.

First, all simfiles & charts have a shared subset of known properties,
documented in :class:`.BaseSimfile` and :class:`.BaseChart`. These are exactly
the known properties for :class:`.SMSimfile` and :class:`.SMChart`. The SSC
format then adds additional known properties on top of the base set.

Here is all of the relevant documentation:
