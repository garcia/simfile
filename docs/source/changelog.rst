v3.0.0-alpha.1
--------------

Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::

    **simfile** 3.0 introduces some breaking changes
    that you may need to update your code to handle:

Python 3.10 or higher required
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**simfile**'s minimum Python version was raised from 3.6 to 3.10.

Strict parsing is now off by default
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Functions in the top-level module,
such as :func:`simfile.open`, :func:`simfile.load`, and :func:`simfile.mutate`,
now default to ``strict=False``.
If you want strict parse errors,
pass ``strict=True`` to restore the old behavior.

Features that are now optional
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :mod:`simfile.assets` submodule
now requires installing **simfile** with the ``assets`` extra.
Run one of these commands to add it to your project::
  
  pip install 'simfile[assets]'  # or...
  poetry add 'simfile[assets]'  # or...
  rye add simfile --features assets
    
The `filesystem` parameter of various functions & methods
now requires installing **simfile** with the ``fs`` extra.
Run one of these commands to add it to your project::

  pip install 'simfile[fs]'  # or...
  poetry add 'simfile[fs]'  # or...
  rye add simfile --features fs
  
If you want to use both of these optional features,
join them with a comma::

  pip install 'simfile[assets,fs]'  # or...
  poetry add 'simfile[assets,fs]'  # or...
  rye add simfile --features assets,fs

Some dict operations no longer supported on simfiles & charts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :data:`.Simfile` and :data:`.Chart` classes (both SM and SSC)
no longer inherit OrderedDict;
instead, they have a private OrderedDict attribute
and forward common dictionary methods & operations to it.

These operations that were previously inherited
by :data:`.Simfile` and :data:`.Chart`
are **not** forwarded:

* The ``clear``, ``copy``, ``popitem``, ``reversed``, ``setdefault``,
  and ``update`` methods from ``dict`` are no longer supported.
* The ``|`` and ``|=`` operators are no longer supported.

These operations **are** forwarded and should behave the same as before:

* ``[key]`` indexing & assignment
* ``len()`` and iteration
* The ``move_to_end`` method from ``OrderedDict``
* The ``keys``, ``values``, ``items``, ``get``, and ``pop`` methods from ``dict``

:class:`.TimingData` and :func:`.displaybpm` parameters changed
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:class:`.TimingData` and :func:`.displaybpm` both now take a single argument,
a :data:`.Simfile` *or* an :data:`.AttachedChart`
(a chart taken from a :data:`.Simfile` - more on this below).
Previously, they took one or two arguments,
a required :data:`.Simfile` and an optional :class:`.Chart`.

If your code passed both a :data:`.Simfile` and a :class:`.Chart`
to either of these classes/functions,
you can probably fix it by removing the first argument (the simfile).
However, this might not work if your :class:`.Chart` is not an :data:`.AttachedChart`.
In that case, append your chart to the simfile's :attr:`~.BaseSimfile.charts`
to *attach* it to the simfile.
Then you can read the attached chart back from the simfile's :attr:`~.BaseSimfile.charts`.

:func:`.group_notes` parameters changed
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:func:`.group_notes`' optional `include_note_types` parameter was removed.
Use the built-in ``filter`` function on the input note data instead.

It was unclear how this parameter interacted with the other parameters.
The fact that such a simple operation was included as a parameter
suggested that it would do something "smarter" under the hood.
Consequently, it was very easy to make mistakes
like excluding :data:`.NoteType.TAIL` while setting `join_heads_to_tails` to `True`.
Other submodules of **simfile** that used :func:`.group_notes` under the hood
even made mistakes like these!

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Attached charts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All charts under a simfile's :attr:`~.charts` attribute
are now instances of :data:`.AttachedChart`,
which is a type union for :class:`.AttachedSMChart` and :class:`.AttachedSSCChart`.
These are subclasses of :class:`.SMChart` and :class:`.SSCChart`
that store a reference to the simfile they came from.

Simfile (de)serialization is now exact
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Deserializing and serializing a :data:`.Simfile` is now byte-for-byte symmetric.
For example,
if you open a simfile with :func:`simfile.mutate`
and don't make any changes,
the output file will exactly match the input file.
This includes whitespace, comments, and any other ephemeral details.

msdparser upgraded
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**simfile**'s dependency on **msdparser** was bumped to 3.0.
This is what made the byte-for-byte symmetry described above possible.
It also fixes a few parsing bugs described below.

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

New, correct :mod:`simfile.notes.counter` module
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :mod:`simfile.notes.count` module has been replaced
by :mod:`simfile.notes.counter`.
The :mod:`.counter` module contains functions with the same names,
but which take an :data:`.AttachedChart` instead of :class:`.NoteData`.
This enables these functions to **omit fake notes from counts**,
fixing a long-standing misparity with StepMania's counts.

Asset discovery matches StepMania
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:class:`.Assets` now discovers images by their dimensions
when no filename-based match is found,
using the same thresholds as StepMania.
This fix required pulling in **pillow** as a dependency,
which is why this feature now requires
specifying the ``assets`` extra during installation.

Missing semicolon recovery matches StepMania
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Missing semicolon recovery is a feature of StepMania's parser
that checks for new lines starting with ``#``
and treats them as new parameters,
even if there was no preceding ``;``.
This was implemented in the msdparser 2.0 dependency,
but it didn't quite have parity with StepMania's parser.
In particular,
the new line wasn't allowed to have whitespace before the ``#``;
only the two-character sequence ``\n#`` could trigger it.
msdparser 3.0 corrects this so that preceding whitespace is allowed.
It also correctly removes all trailing whitespace
(such as the line break)
from the preceding component,
which was another mismatch between msdparser 2.0 and StepMania.

:func:`.openpack` passes kwargs to :func:`.open`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It didn't before. Whoops!

----

v2.1.1
------

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

Two bugs in **simfile** 2.1.0's SSC implementation broke multi-value properties,
causing them to be truncated or mangled past the first value.
This release fixes these issues:

1. When opening an SSC file,
   the `DISPLAYBPM` and `ATTACKS` properties of both simfiles and charts
   no longer stop parsing at the first ``:``.
   For `DISPLAYBPM`, this meant a BPM range of ``120:240``
   would have been incorrectly parsed as a static BPM of ``120``.
   `ATTACKS` were completely broken as they use colon as a separator.
2. The aforementioned properties are now correctly serialized from :class:`.SSCChart`;
   previously, they would have been escaped with backslashes.
   This bug had the same effects described above,
   but only affected manual assignment of multi-value properties
   (e.g. ``chart.displaybpm = "120:240"``)
   since the first bug shadowed this bug during deserialization.

----

v2.1.0
------

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The new :mod:`simfile.dir` module offers
  :class:`.SimfileDirectory` and :class:`.SimfilePack` classes
  for nagivating simfile filesystem structures.
* The new :mod:`simfile.assets` module provides an :class:`.Assets` class
  that can reliably discover paths to simfile assets,
  even if they're not specified in the simfile.
* The top-level :mod:`simfile` module
  now offers :func:`.opendir` and :func:`.openpack` functions
  as simplified interfaces to the :mod:`simfile.dir` API.
* `PyFilesystem2 <https://docs.pyfilesystem.org/en/latest/index.html>`_
  has been integrated throughout this library's filesystem interactions,
  enabling OS and non-OS filesystems to be traversed using the same code.
  All functions, methods, and constructors that lead to filesystem interactions
  now have an optional `filesystem` parameter
  for specifying a PyFS filesystem object.
  When omitted, the filesystem defaults to the native OS filesystem as before.
* The :data:`.DisplayBPM` classes now all expose the same four properties;
  the ones that don't apply to a particular class return None.
  This enables you to handle all three cases
  without having to import the types for ``isinstance`` checks.
  Refer to :ref:`getting-the-displayed-bpm` for more details.

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

* The :data:`.charts` property on simfiles is now writable,
  meaning the list of charts can be overwritten directly
  (not just added to / removed from).
* Backslash escape sequences and multi-value MSD parameters
  are now handled correctly,
  both when opening and serializing simfiles.
  See the Enhancements section below for more details.
* :func:`.sm_to_ssc` no longer produces invalid output
  when there are negative BPMs or stops in the timing data.
  (It throws ``NotImplementedError`` as a temporary stopgap.
  In the future, negative timing data will be converted to warps,
  as StepMania does automatically.)
* Various type annotations have been improved throughout the library.
  In particular, ``Iterator`` input arguments
  have been replaced with ``Iterable``
  so that you don't need to wrap them in ``iter(...)``
  to suppress type errors from static analyzers.

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The dependency on `msdparser <https://msdparser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
  has been upgraded to version 2.
  This corrects parsing of escape sequences and multi-value parameters,
  meaning that ``:`` and ``\`` characters inside a value
  are handled the same way as in StepMania.
  Additionally, parsing is now up to 10 times faster than before!

v2.0.1
------

**Bugfix:**
The dependency on msdparser 1.0.0 was mis-specified
in both the Pipfile and setup.py.
Publishing msdparser 2.0.0-beta.3 (a breaking release)
caused fresh installs to be broken.
This patch fixes the version specification in both files.

----

v2.0.0
------

Initial stable release of version 2.
Refer to :ref:`migrating` for a general overview of the changes
since version 1.
