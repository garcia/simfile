        Convert a stream of notes into note data.

        This method assumes the following preconditions:

        * The input notes are sorted chronologically (ascending beats).
        * Every note's beat is nonnegative.
        * Every note's column is nonnegative and less than `columns`.

        the StepMania editor would produce. StepMania will quantize
        these notes gracefully during gameplay, but you can apply
        :meth:`simfile.timing.Beat.round_to_tick` to each note's beat
        if you'd prefer to keep the note data tidy.
