simfile
=======

A simfile parser for Python. This module currently only supports the .SM
format; .SSC support is planned for the future.

Requirements
------------

Python 2.6 requires [ordereddict](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ordereddict),
which is packaged with Python from 2.7 onward.

Experimental support for Python 3 is available on the
[py3](https://github.com/grantgarcia/simfile/tree/py3) branch.
