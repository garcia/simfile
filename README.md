# simfile

A modern simfile library for Python 3 that supports .sm and .ssc files.

Version 2.0 is a complete overhaul of the 1.0 release (which only supported Python 2 and .sm files). It's in alpha and lacks some of the features that 1.0 offered (some deliberately, others simply as-of-yet unimplemented).

## Installing

    pip3 install --pre simfile

## Documentation

The documentation is a work in progress. It offers an overview of the module-level convenience functions and the classes they return.
